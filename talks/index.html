        I've presented at a wide range of events over the last few years, and most of them are
        listed here. For publications, see my

    <h2>2024</h2>
    <p>
        I relaxed a little at PyCon US this year, with <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/language-summit/">
            a short talk at the language summit</a> (on my new
        <a href="https://github.com/python/peps/pull/3782">PEP 789</a> rather than
        <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0533/">PEP 533</a>) and
        <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/mentored-sprints/">mentored</a> +
        <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/dev-sprints/">development sprints</a>
        filling out my schedule.
    </p>
    <p>
        At <a href="https://2024.northbaypython.org/">North Bay Python</a>, I'll talk
        about advanced topics in Hypothesis - such as test-generation with the
        <a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ghostwriter.html">Ghostwriter</a>
        (<a href="/ghostwriter/">online demo!</a>), coverage-guided fuzzing with
        <a href="https://hypofuzz.com/docs/quickstart.html">HypoFuzz</a>, and our
        experimental support for an SMT-solving backend on Z3...
    </p>
    <p>
        At SciPy 2024, I'll run <a href="https://www.scipy2024.scipy.org/schedule#2024-07-09">
            an introduction to property-based testing</a> tutorial.
    </p>
    <h2>2023</h2>
    <p>
        At PyCon US I <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2023/schedule/presentation/84/">
            presented an introduction to property-based testing</a> and co-organized
        <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2023/events/mentored-sprints/">
            the mentored sprints for diverse newcomers</a>, as well as participating
        in <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2023/events/sprints/">the sprints</a>
        and a <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2023/events/language-summit/">range of</a>
        <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2023/events/maintainers-summit/">summits</a> -
        just like last year!
    </p>
    <p>
        I also gave <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2023/schedule/presentation/85/">a <i>new</i> talk</a>
        on scaling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_concurrency">structured concurrency</a>
        (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrpUb6OEbcc">video</a>).  I think it's one of my best,
        so it will also appear at various meetups and local conferences later this year.
    </p>
    <p>
        At <a href="https://pybay.com/">PyBay</a>, I presented <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqlHqqhTwzA">
            <i>No More Nitpicks</i></a> - sharing how I think about linters, formatters, and autofixers
            as tools for code quality and easier collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
        My plans for StrangeLoop didn't involve speaking... but when another speaker fell
        ill, I was asked if I could write and deliver a talk on forty-six hours notice.
        <a href="https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2023/is-my-large-language-model-a-strange-loop.html">
            <i>Is my Large Language Model a Strange Loop?</i></a>
        (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx2mDuVAClo">video</a>) was the result:
        exploring language models from the 'inside out' and 'outside in' based on
        <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research">Anthropic's research</a> in alignment
        and <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/">interpretability</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>2022</h2>
    <p>
        At PyCon US I <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2022/schedule/presentation/177/">
            presented an introduction to property-based testing</a> and co-organized
        <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2022/events/mentored-sprints/">
            the mentored sprints for diverse newcomers</a>, as well as participating
        in <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2022/events/development-sprints/">the sprints</a>
        and a <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2022/events/language-summit/">range of</a>
        <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2022/events/maintainers-summit/">summits</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        For <a href="https://www.scipy2022.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>, I
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=za7SPz5APKM"> reprised that tutorial
        with an emphasis on scientific and numerical programs.</a>
        I also gave two short talks in plenary sessions&mdash;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGIeR8iV_ho&t=60s">
        an invited tool update about Hypothesis</a>, and a lightning talk about
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEuKtwsdmvU&t=186s">similarities
        between Anthropic's machine learning research and the natural sciences</a>&mdash;and
        led another sprint.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the local <a href="https://pybay.com/">PyBay conference</a>, I gave another
        short talk and was part of a delightful panel session on testing.
    </p>
    <h2>2021</h2>
    <p>
        At PyCon US I spoke about how CPython can adopt property-based testing and
        fuzz those tests with <a href="https://github.com/google/atheris">Atheris</a> and
        <a href="https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz">OSS-Fuzz</a> at
        <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2021/summits/language/">the Language Summit</a>,
        then presenting a <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2021/schedule/presentation/31/">
            tutorial introducing property-based testing</a>
        (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OQLNah25gu_ElpUP0vv379dBDBZXh5LmK6fbnmMJYxM/">slides</a>,
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN6JjpzVsAo">video</a>) and
        a poster about my autoformatter, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/shed/"><code>shed</code></a>.
        Plus my usual involvement with the maintainers' sessions, sprints, and
        <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2021/summits/mentored-sprints/">mentored sprints</a>&mdash;it's
        a busy week even before the time difference!
    </p>
    <p>
        For <a href="https://www.scipy2021.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>, I reprised that tutorial
        with an emphasis on scientific and numerical programs&mdash;and also presented a shorter talk on
        property-based testing for scientists.
        <a href="">Conf42 Python</a> saw a
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV-TbqqUMsA&list=PLIuxSyKxlQrCgKR9qQBmtdnAjTOPKVrLE&index=21&t=25s">
            seriously condensed talk</a>, thanks to video editing. I told PyOhio that
        <a href="https://www.pyohio.org/2021/program/talks/fully-automated-testing">
            <i>I wrote code to write your tests!</i></a>&mdash;and gave a live demo of
        <a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ghostwriter.html">the Ghostwriter</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The talks continued at
        <a href="https://ep2021.europython.eu/talks/5yb9KNo-introduction-to-property-based-testing/">EuroPython</a>,
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210928125758/https://www.pylatam.org/en/full-schedule/talk6/">PyCon Latam</a>,
        <a href="https://in.pycon.org/2021/">PyCon India</a>, and
        <a href="https://pycon.my/">PyCon Malaysia</a>!
        I hope to visit them in-person in some future year.
    </p>
    <h2>2020</h2>
    <p>
        PyCon US went virtual this year, but was still a major event. At
        <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2020/events/languagesummit/">the Language Summit</a> I proposed
        <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/05/property-based-testing-for-python.html">
            writing property-based tests for CPython</a>
        (<a href="https://github.com/Zac-HD/stdlib-property-tests#trophy-case">demo here</a>), which was
        <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/821412/">featured on lwn.net</a>, and gave a lightning talk on
        <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/05/lightning-talks-part-2.html">
            improving <code>SyntaxError</code> for novices</a>. I also helped organise
        <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2020/hatchery/mentoredsprints/">the mentored sprints</a>,
        as well as mentoring new contributors on the day.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was invited to the <a href="https://conf.python.ru/en/2020/">Moscow Python conference</a>,
        and gave <a href="https://conf.python.ru/moscow/2020/abstracts/6387">my talk</a> online.
        At the <a href="https://www.scipy2020.scipy.org/">SciPy conference</a> I presented
        <a href="../2020/scipy/">an online poster</a>, and published a paper on
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.25080/Majora-342d178e-016">testing scientific code</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        At <a href="https://2020.pycon.org.au/">PyCon Australia</a>, I told the audience to
        <a href="/2020/pyconau"><i>Stop Writing Tests!</i></a>
        (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiy031EoDXo">video</a>)&mdash;announcing both the
        <a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ghostwriter.html">Hypothesis Ghostwriter</a>
        and <a href="https://hypofuzz.com">HypoFuzz</a>, a new tool for adaptive fuzzing.
        On the <a href="https://2020.pycon.org.au/program/sun/">social day</a>, I coordinated the
        development sprints and ran an all-day
        <a href="https://mentored-sprint-for-diverse-beginners.readthedocs.io/">mentoring event</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was delighted to reprise <a href="/2020/pyconau"><i>Stop Writing Tests!</i></a> for
        <a href="https://in.pycon.org/2020/#schedule">PyCon India</a> and
        <a href="https://pyjamas.live/">Pyjamas Ireland</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>2019</h2>
    <p>
        I was rather busy at PyCon US, where among other things I presented a
        <a href="https://pycon-archive.python.org/2019/schedule/presentation/91/">tutorial</a>,
        <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/schedule/presentation/217/">talk</a>, and
        <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/schedule/presentation/136/">poster</a>
        (<a href="/_static/2019-hypothesis-poster.pdf">pdf</a>) about
        'escaping from auto-manual testing' with Hypothesis. I also attended the
        <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/events/language-summit/">Language Summit</a>, spoke at the
        <a href="https://pycon-archive.python.org/2019/hatchery/maintainers/">maintainers summit</a>,
        and led teams at both <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/community/sprints/">the sprints</a>
        and <a href="https://pycon-archive.python.org/2019/hatchery/mentoredsprints/">mentored sprints</a>.
        It was a fantastic&mdash;and very intense&mdash;nine days.
    </p>
    <p>
        At <a href="https://www.eagxaustralia.com/">EAGx Sydney</a>, I posed
        <a href="/_static/2019-questions-for-machines.pdf">'some questions for 21<sup>st</sup>
            century machines'</a> based on my work at the
        <a href="https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au/about/about-3a-institute/"> Autonomy, Agency, and Assurance Institute</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        At PyCon Australia I presented one of the inaugural 'deep dive' talks, on
        <a href="https://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/sufficiently-advanced-testing">
            Sufficiently Advanced Testing</a>. I think this is my best technical talk to date,
        and wrote up <a href="/sufficiently">a hyperlinked transcript for this site</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        At <a href="https://www.scipy2019.scipy.org/">SciPy US</a>, I <a
            href="https://www.scipy2019.scipy.org/talks-posters/Test-Research-Code-the-Easy-Way%3A-By-Generating-Random-Inputs-with-Hypothesis">
            gave a talk</a> and
        <a href="https://www.scipy2019.scipy.org/tutorial/Escape-from-Auto-manual-Testing-with-Hypothesis%21">
            taught a workshop</a> on advanced testing for scientists and developers of data science tools,
        which I later reprised in Spain for <a href="https://www.euroscipy.org/2019/">EuroSciPy</a>
        (<a href="https://pretalx.com/euroscipy-2019/talk/SZ8S8G/">talk</a>,
        <a href="https://pretalx.com/euroscipy-2019/talk/ZHQALW/">tutorial</a>).
        The material for my 2019 tutorial <a href="https://github.com/Zac-HD/escape-from-automanual-testing/">
            is open source and available here</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>2018</h2>
    <p>
        At the European Union's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220203234946/https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/fta2018"><i>Future in the Making</i></a>
        conference, I presented <a href="/_static/2018-crafting-policy.pdf">a poster</a> about 3Ai's
        Collaboratoria&mdash;immersive experiences bringing togther researchers, scholars and practitioners.
    </p>
    <p>
        At PyCon Asia-Pacific, I taught a workshop on
        <a href="https://pycon.sg/archive/2018/schedule/index.html">
            property-based testing and other insecticides</a>.

        At the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220124110652/https://pylondinium.org/2018/">inaugural PyLondinium</a>, I gave
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211027042722/https://pylondinium.org/2018/talk.html?talk_id=8">a talk about property-based testing</a>
        (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MC-PB1LDB4">video</a>)

        ...and <a href="https://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/44889-escape-from-automanual-testing-with-hypothesis/">
            an updated version</a> at PyCon Australia.
    </p>
    <h2>2017</h2>
    <p>
        I presented my Honours research project at the annual conference of
        the <a href="https://www.amos.org.au/">Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society</a>.
        My talk won a student presentation prize, and
        <a href="/_static/ZHD-Yolngu-seasons-poster.pdf">my poster</a> was also well received.
        My <a href="/_static/ZHD-Yolngu-seasons-thesis.pdf">full Honours thesis can be read here</a>.
