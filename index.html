        I lead the Assurance team at <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic, an AI safety and research company</a>
        in San Francisco, building reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the <a href="https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au/about/about-3a-institute/">Autonomy, Agency, and Assurance Institute</a>,
        I helped to reimagine cybernetics for the 21<sup>st</sup> century.
        How can we take cyber-physical systems safely to scale when they embed sensing, learning,
        and communications in everything from cars to hospitals to elections to intimate relationships?
    </p>

        I also volunteer for community organisations.  Before moving to SF, I served
        on the board of the ACT <a href="https://crs.org.au">Conflict Resolution Service</a>
        and the executive of <a href="https://anusa.com.au/life/club/7018/">Effective Altruism ANU</a>;
        and I continue to organise less formal events like
        <a href="https://www.mentored-sprints.dev/about/">mentored sprints</a> at many conferences.
    </p>
    <p>
        I regularly contribute to <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source">open source software</a>,
        which empowers users and invites them to become creators, and have
        <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/04/python-software-foundation-fellow.html">been recognised</a>
        as a <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/membership/">PSF Fellow</a>.
        Lately I've focussed on making software testing easier and much more effective.
        I'm the lead developer of <a href="https://hypothesis.works">Hypothesis</a>
        (and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/hypothesmith">some</a>
        <a href="https://pypi.org/project/hypothesis-jsonschema">extensions</a> -
        <a href="./ghostwriter/">here's a live demo!</a> -
        and I co-maintain <a href="https://pytest.org">Pytest</a>.
        I started <strong><a href="https://hypofuzz.com">hypofuzz.com</a></strong> to support
        open source development and sell next-generation testing and verification tools.
    </p>
    <p>
        I often speak at conferences, and most of my public presentations
        <a href="/talks">are listed here</a>. Highlights include exploring
        <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research">Anthropic's alignment</a> and
        <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/">interpretability</a> research in
        <a href="https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2023/is-my-large-language-model-a-strange-loop.html">
            an invited talk</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx2mDuVAClo">video</a>)
        at StrangeLoop 2023,
        talks about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcyGUVzL7HA">property-based testing</a> and
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcyGUVzL7HA">structured concurrency</a> at PyCon US,

        at PyCon Australia (<a href="sufficiently">transcript</a>), and winning an
        <a href="https://www.amos.org.au/">AMOS</a> presentation prize for my Honours research characterising
