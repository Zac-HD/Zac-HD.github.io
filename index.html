    <h3>Things I do</h3>
    <p>
        I'm a researcher at the <a href="https://3ainstitute.cecs.anu.edu.au/">
            Autonomy, Agency, and Assurance Institute</a>,
        at the <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/">Australian National University</a>.
        I spend my time there reading, thinking, talking, and teaching about what's happening as we embed sensing,
        learning, communicating, and acting computers in everything else.
        Everyone's talking about cars, but what about medical devices? Trains? Elections? Your home?
    </p>
    <p>
        I also volunteer for community organisations.
        I'm on the board of the ACT <a href="https://crs.org.au">Conflict Resolution Service</a>,
        and have held a variety of national roles in the <a href="https://assembly.uca.org.au">Uniting Church</a>
        including two terms on the Assembly standing committee.
    </p>
    <p>
        I regularly contribute to <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source">open source software</a>,
        which empowers users and invites them to become creators.
        Lately I've focussed on making software testing easier and much more effective.
        I'm a core developer of <a href="https://hypothesis.works">Hypothesis</a>
        (and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/hypothesmith">some</a>
        <a href="https://pypi.org/project/hypothesis-jsonschema">extensions</a>)
        and a <a href="https://pytest.org">Pytest</a> maintainer.
        Python's scientific stack is starting to adopt property-based testing, which is very exciting!
    </p>
    <p>
        I often speak at conferences, and most of my public presentations
        <a href="/talks">are listed here</a>. Highlights include
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcyGUVzL7HA">introducing property-based testing</a> at PyCon US,
        <a href="https://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/sufficiently-advanced-testing">an expert deep-dive</a>
        at PyCon Australia (<a href="sufficiently">transcript</a>), and winning an
        <a href="https://www.amos.org.au/">AMOS</a> presentation prize for my Honours research characterising
        Indigenous seasons (<a href="/_static/ZHD-Yolngu-seasons-poster.pdf">poster</a>,
        <a href="/_static/ZHD-Yolngu-seasons-thesis.pdf">thesis</a>).
